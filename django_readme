1)Create Project
django-admin startproject Myproject
2)Run the server
python manage.py runserver
Open tab in browser and type http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
3)Create admin credentails
Create Username and password for admin app
python manage.py createsuperuser
We need to create a table now as it is giving error
4)create schema(makemigrations) and execute schema on db(migrate)
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Now again run this
python manage.py createsuperuser
5)Create app
python manage.py startapp home
A new folder is created
Project doesnot know about app
    1)Go to setting.py add 'home' in INSTALLED_APPS
    2)Go to urls.py, from that it will go to various apps
    3)add path('',include(home.urls)) in urls_pattern and change import path to import path,include import home.url
    #from browser url the control goes to myprog/urls (it checks for full url but if not in path list then it will break the url which will be satisfied by '' thus it will go to home/urls.pyand then to home/urls.py and admin/urls then from home/urls.py it goes to views.py and then we wrote a function def homepage
    4)Copy urls.py file from Myproject to home
    5)Change file as from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path,include
    from.import views

    urlpatterns = [path('',views.homepage)]
    6)Open views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render,HttpResponse
    def homepage(request):
    return HttpResponse('Welcome')

    Now run the server

Noe add this path('about/',views.aboutpage) in home/urls.py
